          <p class="lead">
            25 years of Spatial experience spanning military, civilian, minerals, oil, gas, and water.
            I mostly enjoy creating programs that make mine and my teams job easier and faster, and love getting cola splashed on my keyboard while chipping away at Python and Django projects.
            When I’m not working I’m studying, cartooing, or working on my home built arcade machine. My doggo is usually right by my side chewing or snoring.
            My interest in IT developed later in life – around when I was 25-ish, it was sparked by discovering the ability to make work easier and just grew from there.
            I don’t have any experience in any IT role, however throughout my miiltary and civiilian career
            I’ve bashed out many aa script to achieve a task a little bit faster or more accuratethan without it.
            I chose to study at RMIT as it is a completley online course that suits my current FIFO lifestyle.
            I expect to learn how become an IT professional, to learn more advanced concepts on programming than what can (currently) be achieved through microcourses online.
            Eventually I hope to transition from my spatial career to a career in software development;
            as I’d like to continue - albeit at a far more advanced level – creating and solving problems through programming.

          <h4>And what I say about them!</h4>
          <p>I didn’t place much confidence in the tests to begin with;  however after completing the Myers Briggs, and the EducationPlanner.org Learning Style tests, I realised they managed to predict my personaility to quite finely, and with the results ans the tips they provide, can probably make me manage some of my traits somewhat better. The Big5 didn’t seem to agree with my own view of myself.</p>
          <p>Seeing these results will make me a better team member, the Myers Briggs report highlights my personailty is likley to “take charge, organise a job, and carry it through.” And whilst I naturally lean toward taking over and ensuring ‘mission success’, in this learning environment it may benefit myself and the team if support another leader instead.</p>
            <p>I’m quite open to forming a team without viewing personailty tests first, if this were how teams were formed there’d be some good talent sitting on the sideline for failoure of being chosen.
              I do see the value in these tests and think perhaps it would be a more productive and positive experience for the team to conduct personailty tests after formation, then discuss as a team to find the best way to progress.</p>

                <p>I’ve created my project with the goal of attempting to improve the world of darts through the creation of a Darts Club Management System (DCMS),
                  the DCMS is created through combining modern web and app technology. The DCSM will do away with non-random competition draws,
                  chalkboard scoring, mistaken mathematics, and, provide a live stream of any current darts game dart-by-dart, whilst also linking the clubs around the world statistically, and socially.</p>

                <p>I love darts, I love the social aspect, the competitive aspect, and, the history and heritage of the game.
                What I don’t love is how it so isolated to you and your team, extending only really to the local clubs and not much further.
                For years world darts leagues are ‘chalked’ ie they’re scored on a chalkboard. Once the game is over there’s a piece of paper with the scores and a few stats but nothing permanent – occasional darts websites excepted.
                There’s also nothing to tie the clubs together, or the leagues, or the greater world darts community. There’s no standardised club management system despite a (mostly) standard set of club rules,
                there’s no standard way to draw players and have them compete in a league without ‘borrowing’ from others websites.
                  There’s no statistics unless you’re really good, but no one truly knows you’re really good unless you turn up and go ‘through the ranks’ and hope local politics doesn’t have you sidelined before you’ve warmed up.</p>

                <p>At it’s most basic funciton, the DCMS will allow for members to register and select a club they are a member of. The Club can then manage the membership of individual members.
                  Expanding on this will be the management of leagues, matches and game draws; thse would be able to be completed either online or using a mobile app. Then, at it’s most advanced stage,
                  the DCMS can be used for scoring each individual game, and tracking each dart thrown to be able to compile and present statitics for each member, club, league, competition and tournament.
                  An example of the statistics offered may be player accuracy heat maps  - which can then be used to provide fair matchmaking or handicaps.
                  Included in the DCMS will be varying rulesets for each game, turnkey rulesets, charters, and constitutions for each club, committee management tools, member voting tools,
                  the ability to connect to other players, match broadcasting tools either through a weblink to a match-in-progress where scores are updated in real time or by connection through Twitter API and auto-tweeting games as they’re played.</p>

                <p>Although the skills required for this would seem broad at first, they are mostly ‘ordinary web building skills.
                <ul>
                <li>Django or Ruby on Rails</li>
                <li>PostGreSQL</li>
                <li>Swift</li>
                <li>Java,</li>
                <li>JavaScript, including react.js</li>
                <li>VCS / Git.</li>
                <li>AWS server management</li>
              </ul>

                No special hardware would be required.

                  The software skills for creating this are easily found in online marketplaces such as Freelancer. From my experience the most difficult part is deploying to the AWS environment. This is due to expertise required in establishing scalable cloud infrastrure, and, the lack of tutorials an duser guides available – which provide limited help due to not being maintained as fast as the AWS environ,ent changes. A person with AWS experience would be required to be found.</p>

                <p>If the project is successful it will provide an alternative to the current non-harmonised darts clubs, provide structure and uniformity to darts club management, and, enable smaller clubs to run at the same level as larger clubs without labourious administrative overheads, due to it’s online club management framework.
                  Whether or not this project has a real world impact would be decided upon by the club’s own uptake of the system.</p>
